Clue is a simple collection of useful middleware for Django. It currently
provides a handful of new capabilities via a modified runserver command:

./manage.py runclueserver

Currently it supports three alternative views which are useful for
performance tuning. All of these can be appended to any URL running 
on the above mentioned development server.

?query - provides a list of queries run to generate the page, including 
a breakdown of slow queries and repeated queries

?template - a list of all the templates used to render the page

?prof - a process profile showing where you spend most of
your time when rendering the view

Credit for much of this work goes to others. The middleware was mainly
based on code from Django Snippets, often tweaked and modified for use with
Django 1.0 and with a few changes to the interface. The team at Global Radio 
also have similar tools from which I took ideas.
