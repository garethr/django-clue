Clue is a simple collection of useful middleware for Django. It currently
provides a handful of new debugging capabilities via a modified runserver command or by loading a collection of middleware.

h2. Installation

Clue wants to be installed somewhere on your python path. The quickest way of achieving that is the packaged setup.py file.

pre. python setup.py install

h2. Usage

pre. ./manage.py runclueserver

Alternatively you can add the middleware to your settings.py file, although it is advisable to avoid running these in a production environment.

pre. if DEBUG:
    settings.MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES += (
        'clue.middleware.query.QueryMiddleware',
        'clue.middleware.profiler.ProfileMiddleware',
        'clue.middleware.template.TemplateMiddleware',
    )

Currently it supports three alternative views for each normal view, all of which are useful for performance tuning. All of these can be appended to any URL running on the above mentioned development server.

Credit for much of this work goes to others. The middleware was mainly
based on code from Django Snippets, often tweaked and modified for use with
Django 1.0 and with a few changes to the interface. The team at Global Radio 
also have similar tools from which I took ideas.

h2. Alternative Views

Simply append the specified query string arguments to a url and it should render useful information depending on which of the following you choose.

h3. Query Analysis

?query - provides a list of queries run to generate the page, including 
a breakdown of slow queries and repeated queries

h3. Template Loading

?template - a list of all the templates used to render the page

h3. Profiling

?prof - a process profile showing where you spend most of
your time when rendering the view
